# Data Modeling with Postgres

## Purpose

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. 

## Schema Design

Using the song and log datasets, a **star schema** is created and optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table

1. songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
   - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

#### Dimension Tables

1. **users** \- users in the app
   - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
2. **songs** \- songs in music database
   - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
3. **artists** \- artists in music database
   - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
4. **time** \- timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
   - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## ETL Pipeline

* Process `song_data`

  * `songs` table

    * Extract Data for Songs Table

      - Select columns for song ID, title, artist ID, year, and duration
      - Use `df.values` to select just the values from the dataframe
      - Index to select the first (only) record in the dataframe
      - Convert the array to a list and set it to `song_data`

    * Insert Record into Song Table

      Implement the `song_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` and run the cell below to insert a record for this song into the `songs` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `songs` table in the sparkify database.

  * `artists` table

    * Extract Data for Artists Table

      - Select columns for artist ID, name, location, latitude, and longitude
      - Use `df.values` to select just the values from the dataframe
      - Index to select the first (only) record in the dataframe
      - Convert the array to a list and set it to `artist_data`

    * Insert Record into Artist Table

      Implement the `artist_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` and run the cell below to insert a record for this song's artist into the `artists` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `artists` table in the sparkify database.

* Process `log_data`

  * `time` table
    * Extract Data for Time Table
      - Filter records by `NextSong` action
      - Convert the `ts` timestamp column to datetime
        - Hint: the current timestamp is in milliseconds
      - Extract the timestamp, hour, day, week of year, month, year, and weekday from the `ts` column and set `time_data` to a list containing these values in order
        - Hint: use pandas' [`dt` attribute](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.html) to access easily datetimelike properties.
      - Specify labels for these columns and set to `column_labels`
      - Create a dataframe, `time_df,` containing the time data for this file by combining `column_labels` and `time_data` into a dictionary and converting this into a dataframe
    * Insert Records into Time Table
      Implement the `time_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` and run the cell below to insert records for the timestamps in this log file into the `time` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `time` table in the sparkify database.
  * `user` table
    * Extract Data for Users Table
      - Select columns for user ID, first name, last name, gender and level and set to `user_df`
    * Insert Records into Users Table
      Implement the `user_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` and run the cell below to insert records for the users in this log file into the `users` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `users` table in the sparkify database.
  * `songplays` table
    * Extract Data and Songplays Table
      This one is a little more complicated since information from the songs table, artists table, and original log file are all needed for the `songplays` table. Since the log file does not specify an ID for either the song or the artist, you'll need to get the song ID and artist ID by querying the songs and artists tables to find matches based on song title, artist name, and song duration time.
      - Implement the `song_select` query in `sql_queries.py` to find the song ID and artist ID based on the title, artist name, and duration of a song.
      - Select the timestamp, user ID, level, song ID, artist ID, session ID, location, and user agent and set to `songplay_data`
    * Insert Records into Songplays Table
      - Implement the `songplay_table_insert` query and run the cell below to insert records for the songplay actions in this log file into the `songplays` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `songplays` table in the sparkify database.
